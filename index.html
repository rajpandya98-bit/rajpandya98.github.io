<strong>Biomedical Engineer</strong> — R&D • Quality • Validation (Medical Devices & Pharmaceuticals)
</p>

<p>
Biomedical engineer with hands-on experience in research and development, quality
engineering, and validation activities for medical device and pharmaceutical
applications. Skilled in bioinstrumentation, analog signal conditioning, verification
testing, and risk-aware design to support reliable and compliant product development.

  <h2>Featured Project: Fall Detection System</h2>
  <p>
This project focuses on the design and evaluation of a fall detection system intended
to demonstrate reliable motion sensing and validation-oriented engineering practices
commonly used in medical device development. The system was built using a three-axis
analog accelerometer (ADXL335) combined with LM358-based signal conditioning to ensure
stable and interpretable sensor data.
</p>

<p>
Rather than prioritizing complex algorithms, the project emphasizes core engineering
principles including analog signal integrity, noise reduction, threshold-based event
detection, and systematic testing. The system continuously monitors acceleration across
multiple axes and identifies fall-like events based on sudden changes exceeding defined
limits.
</p>

<p>
Significant attention was given to verification and validation activities, including
bench testing, simulated real-world motion scenarios, and evaluation of false-positive
and false-negative behavior. Observed limitations were documented to support a
risk-aware and iterative design approach aligned with quality and validation
expectations in regulated medical device and pharmaceutical environments.

  <p>
    Designed a low-cost fall detection system using a 3-axis accelerometer (ADXL335)
    and analog signal conditioning (LM358).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented filtering and amplification for stable ADC input</li>
    <li>Developed threshold-based fall detection logic</li>
    <li>Tested system performance across daily activities and simulated falls</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
The schematic was designed to ensure reliable analog signal acquisition by incorporating
appropriate filtering and amplification stages prior to analog-to-digital conversion.
Design decisions focused on minimizing noise and improving signal stability during
dynamic motion conditions.

<ul>
  <li>Bench-tested acceleration response across X, Y, Z axes</li>
  <li>Verified threshold response for simulated fall events</li>
  <li>Evaluated false positives during normal activities (walking, sitting)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations observed include sensitivity to abrupt non-fall movements, highlighting
the need for more advanced classification methods in <h2>Quality Engineering Project: Design Verification, Validation & Risk Analysis</h2>

<p>
Applied quality engineering principles to the fall detection system to evaluate
design robustness, safety considerations, and compliance with medical device
development practices.
</p>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
To verify that design outputs met defined design inputs and to validate that the
system performance aligned with intended use, while identifying and mitigating
potential risks.
</p>

<h3>Verification Activities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Defined functional design inputs including response time, detection threshold, and signal stability</li>
  <li>Conducted bench-level verification testing across X, Y, and Z acceleration axes</li>
  <li>Verified repeatability of sensor response under controlled motion conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validation Activities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simulated real-world use scenarios such as walking, sitting, and fall-like motion</li>
  <li>Evaluated system behavior relative to intended use rather than only specifications</li>
  <li>Documented performance limitations observed during testing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Analysis (ISO 14971 – Conceptual)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identified hazards including false negatives, false positives, and sensor drift</li>
  <li>Assessed potential impact on user safety and system reliability</li>
  <li>Implemented basic risk controls such as signal filtering, threshold optimization, and calibration checks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
This project strengthened understanding of quality-driven development by integrating
verification, validation, and risk-based thinking into the engineering workflow rather
than treating quality as a post-design activity.
