  <h2>Featured Project: Fall Detection System</h2>

signal conditioning and microcontroller input.
</em></p>

  <p>
    Designed a low-cost fall detection system using a 3-axis accelerometer (ADXL335)
    and analog signal conditioning (LM358).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented filtering and amplification for stable ADC input</li>
    <li>Developed threshold-based fall detection logic</li>
    <li>Tested system performance across daily activities and simulated falls</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
The schematic was designed to ensure reliable analog signal acquisition by incorporating
appropriate filtering and amplification stages prior to analog-to-digital conversion.
Design decisions focused on minimizing noise and improving signal stability during
dynamic motion conditions.
</p>
  <h3>Testing & Validation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bench-tested acceleration response across X, Y, Z axes</li>
  <li>Verified threshold response for simulated fall events</li>
  <li>Evaluated false positives during normal activities (walking, sitting)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations observed include sensitivity to abrupt non-fall movements, highlighting
the need for more advanced classification methods in future iterations.
